After a rapid, iterative model tuning and parameter search as shown here, a well performing model can be translated into a different language and optimized. Would trading a few accuracy points give us a smaller, faster model? Is it worth optimizing memory usage, perhaps using `mmap` to share memory across processes?\n",

These days, even the open source world can offer viable solutions in all of these areas. All the tool shown today are free for commercial use, under OSI-approved open source licenses."
